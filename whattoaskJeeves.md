I am trying to create a combat simulator to do a mathematical analysis on the mobile game FGO or Fate Grand Order, I have all the characters stats and skills and noble phantasms in a mongodb database and all the difficult quest saved. I know the game mechanics but I am having difficulty creating a function in python that will read in a skill, np, or passive then apply it to the game state if it is possible. The difficulty comes from some abilities having conditions that I do not know how to implement such as the following character kit for Archetype Earth. If I give you her kit as well as what it does in english could you help me program a function that affects the game state if the ability is used. This does not mean to use all of a characters abilities as soon as possible, some times it is optimal to use a skill at a certain time or use an NP in a certain scenario. So I would like to create a class GameState and functions in it such as Enemies list which will hold enemy statistics but for now it will just hold an array of numbers that will act as the health bar of the enemy like so [100000, 10000, 10000] which is 3 enemies with 1 enemy having hp 100,000 and the other 2 having hp 10,000. Then I will have 4 functions use_skill1, use_skill2, use_skill3, use_NP for each servant and there can be a total of 3 servants on the field at any time. I have a class called servants that already extracts their skills, stats and NPs but it extracts them in JSON format and I do not know how to apply them but I will work on that later
