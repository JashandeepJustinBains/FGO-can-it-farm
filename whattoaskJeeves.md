if servant.id == aoko:
    create additional servant at the end of the servant list whos abilities go on cooldown along with aoko 1
    swap places when NP is used (always used on the first wave so we could just put this in the end turn section)
if servant.id == melusine1:
    options:
        1. program ascensions and consider all ascension possibilities
        2. assume melusine starts in asc1 or asc2 always so we use ability 3.1 then swap that ability to 3.2
